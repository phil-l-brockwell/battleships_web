During this task I was paired with [Paul Fitzgerald](https://github.com/Pau1fitz). 

In the space of three days we were able to code a working 2 player solution. Although this solution did have some limitations.
For example: all of the ships were hard coded, and both players had to use the same machine.

# Future Enhancements

* Players can place ships before the game
* Players can select size of board
* More testing
* Extract as much logic as possible into models
* Add game over view, with option to restart
